# Writing a Text Adventure

Creating a text adventure is a useful exercise for beginninng game designer-developers. Text adventures focus on world-building and storytelling. The objects, mechanics, and effects in the game are (almost all) text. This helps designers develop their ability to describe game elements using words, which is crucial to good design documentation. It also provides a relatively low cost way to develop design and visualization skills.

## Getting an idea

Start your design with a concept or idea, and develop from there. You may start with any of the following:

- Characters. Who are the characters who are required for this story. No need to list every NPC or living thing that the player may encounter. List only those who have an impact on the progress or outcome of the story.
- Setting/environment. Describe the setting, and any changes it goes through during your story. For example, Zork begins in a rather benign pastoral setting. Then there is a house, a forest, a cave, etc. Don't worry about specific rooms at first. We are concerned with settings that change something significant about the mood or gameplay. (If you have more than 7-10 distinct settings, you may wish to rethink your scope.)  
- Plot. What happens? In what order? Specifically, what decisions or events drive the story from its beginning to its end state?
- Conflict. Most stories have a conflict or tension that makes them more interesting to us than just a list of events. It need not be combat, or even 
- Mechanics. Are there important objects, mechanics, or other non-character elements in your game?

However you start, sketch out something for all of the above elements before proceeding.

## Story beats

Story (or game) beats are the significant events that drive a story forward and determine its outcome. In a nonlinear game, they may happen at different times in different playthroughs.

- What are the main points in the plot? These will mostly be described in terms of player decisions. Is there a climactic episode in your game? Is there an initiating event?
- What are the locations where the important events happen? What is special about them? How does the player reach them? (Some of these may be separate from the player. For example, an initiating event may happen in a location the player never visits. In this case, how is the location "activated"?)
- What objects, characters, or other game elements must be in place for each event?

One or more diagrams can help you understand and specify the story beats.
